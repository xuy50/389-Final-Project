**# Final-Project**

Final project proposal<br>
I want to build a Simon Game. It basically has 4 button with 4 LED like general Simon Game, and I will use the LCD to show what is the level the player in, and show how much time left the player can do this level, after the time finishes, the game will be over, and the LCD will show the result. I want to add a buzzer to play 4 kinds of sound effects for the Simon Game, and I want to add a failure sound effect for the game failure with buzzer. If the player press the buttons in the wrong order, the game will be over.
